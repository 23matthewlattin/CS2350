			<h2>The Challenges</h2>
		<p>
			The country voted on what the challenges would be. They could choose from 
			video game challenges, athletic challenges, and academic challenges. The top 
			two challenges were the ones the contestants would compete in. It was decided that 
			they would have a game of basketball and a game show type challenge to test their knowledge.
			If each of them win one challenge they will have a game of rock paper scissors to decide the 
			winner.

		<h2>Basketball</h2>
		<p>
			For the basketball game the contestants had teammates. The teammates were chosen from members of congress.
			Joe Biden and Donald Trump didn't have teammates who were good at basketball. The game was just a bunch of
			people embarrasing themselves in front of the country by not doing good at all. They played a 20 minute game 
			and in the end Joe Biden had 12 points and Donald Trump had 13.

		<h3>After the Game</h3>
		<p>
			After the game both Joe Biden and Donald Trump 
			were really weak and could hardly move. They both were hospitalized and decided that they couldn't be president.
			It was decided that two random people from the country would replace them. Their names were Bob and Joe. No one 
			knows their last names.
		</p>

	<section id="knowledge" class="col-1-3">
		<h2>The Game Show</h2>
		<p>
			For the game show it was set up like Jeopardy where Bob and Joe had to buzz in to answer the questions.
			The questions were on a bunch of random things that not a lot of people know. Somehow Bob got all of the questions right.
			Because Bob replaced Joe Biden this meant that it was all tied up.

		<h2>Rock Paper Scissors</h2>
		<p>
			In the rock paper scissors game they had a best out of 7. There was a lot of ties that made the game last
			almost an hour. In the end Bob won the game. He became the president the next week because of how long this 
			took.
