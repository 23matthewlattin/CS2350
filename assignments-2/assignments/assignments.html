			<h1>Assignments</h1>
			<p>There are 3 different types of activities. They are learning, try it out, 
			and challenge activities.</p>
			<p>The learning activities teach us new concepts and have us follow along in 
			typing code to learn what these new concepts do and how we can use them.</p>
			<p>The try it out activities give us a chance to practice what we the learning 
			activiy we did taught us. We are supposed to make a website look the same as it 
			does in the example by following along with the instructions.</p>
			<p>The challenge activites are what we do last. We have one of them per module 
			of learning and they are worth a lot of the grade. They combine what we learned 
			throughout the module in the learning and try it out activities.
