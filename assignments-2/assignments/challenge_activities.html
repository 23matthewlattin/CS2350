			<h2>Assignments Website</h2>
			<p>
			In this website I used new skills such as creating the files for a website and using CSS
			in a website to style it the way that I want. I also used skils of adding links and images to the
			website. I like the colors and fonts that I used in this project. It was difficult formatting the 
			website to look good and make sense.

				<h2>Activity Page</h2>

				<a href="../ActivityPage/story_layout1.html">Story Layout 1</a>

				</p>
				<p>
					In this challenge activity we had to make an 
					html page and mark it up with css. We then had to copy
					the html from the first into a new file and make a new css file to make 
					a seperate page where the content in
					the first and second is the same but doesn't look the same.
					We also had to make a  
					table that has our daily schedule on it. 
					<p>Skills that I used were formatting the page to be fluid so the elements
					are able to position themselves based on the dimensions of the browser. I also used skills
					of floating elements and controlling their widths.</p>
					<p>I like that I was able to make a story that I wanted and include
					the content that I wanted.</p>
					<p>It was hard for me to get the elements positioned how I want and go next to images.</p>

				<h2>Add Graphic Design</h2>
				<a href="assignments.html">Home page of Assignments website</a>
				<img src="images/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" />
				<p>
					In this project I used muliple new skills. I added shadow to boxes and text. I also used
					new skills of tranforming elements so they dispaly at angles on pages and there is some 
					perspective added to them. I also added an image with an image map. I added background images
					including multiple in the same element. I also added gradients to my website.
				</p>
				<p>
					I like the design elements I was able to add to make the website look more interesting and have
					more designs to it. This project was fun because I was able to try out new skills that I enjoyed being
					able to experiment with.
